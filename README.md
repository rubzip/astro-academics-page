A fast, minimalist, and highly customizable Astro template designed specifically for researchers, professors, PhD students, and academics. 

Strongly inspired by [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper), this template prioritizes content readability, SEO discoverability, and ease of configuration without touching the UI code.

## ✨ Features

- **Markdown-Driven Collections:** Easily manage your Bio, Blog, Publications, Projects, Talks, CV, and Teaching experience purely through `.md` files.
- **Academic Standard Support:** Out-of-the-box $\LaTeX$ rendering support via KaTeX. Includes structured metadata for Google Scholar indexing (DOI, Journal, PDF Links).
- **Extensive Theming System:** Built-in Light/Dark mode toggle with a highly customizable underlying design system and several beautiful preset palettes (`notepad`, `leafBlue`, `pikkyDark`, etc).
- **Toggleable Sections:** Don't need a "Talks" or "Teaching" section? Disable them globally with a single boolean flag in your config.
- **Peak Performance:** Built with Astro v6 and Tailwind CSS v4, yielding near-perfect Lighthouse scores and 0kb of unnecessary client-side JavaScript.
- **Privacy-First Analytics:** Includes native configuration options for self-hosted Umami analytics, as well as GA4 support—with built-in lazy-loading strategies to protect Core Web Vitals.
