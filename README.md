A fast, minimalist, and highly customizable Astro template designed specifically for researchers, professors, PhD students, and academics. 

Strongly inspired by [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper), this template prioritizes content readability, SEO discoverability, and ease of configuration without touching the UI code.

## ✨ Features

- **Markdown-Driven Collections:** Easily manage your `Bio`, `Blog`, `Publications`, `Projects`, `Talks`, `CV`, and `Teaching` experience purely through `.md` files, **no programming knowledge required**.
- **Academic Standard Support:** Out-of-the-box $\LaTeX$ rendering support via `remark-math`/`rehype-katex`.
- **Extensive Theming System:** Built-in Light/Dark mode toggle with a highly customizable underlying design system and several preset color palettes.
- **Toggleable Sections:** Don't need a "Talks" or "Teaching" section? Disable them globally with a single boolean flag in your config.
- **Peak Performance:** Built with Astro and Tailwind CSS v4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite`), yielding near-perfect Lighthouse scores and minimal client-side JavaScript.
- **Analytics:** Includes native configuration options for self-hosted Umami analytics (`umami.websiteId`), as well as GA4 support (`ga4Id`).
- **Two-Column Architecture:** Optimized layout with a sticky left profile sidebar and a scrollable main content area.
